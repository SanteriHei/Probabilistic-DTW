# Probabilistic-DTW
This repository contains an implementation of PDTW method for unsupervised discovery of recurring speech patterns


## Low res search progress 
- [x] feature extraction
- [x] Voice activity detection
- [ ] random distance calculations (needs debugging)
- [ ] finding nearest segments with probabilistic distances (needs debugging)

## High res search progress
- [ ] Random distance calculations
- [ ] Calculate the real alignment paths
